Project based on a school assignment where the task was to create a website for the port of Djupvik.
Requirements for the assignment was to use pre-written texts and images and create a fully functional website
that works and looks good at different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
We also had to implement a weather widget that gathers weather data from the SMHI API and presents it to the user.
